When you want to migrate your Heroku Postgres database, you'll need to run the migration command prefaced with heroku run from inside your repository.

** heroku run npx sequelize-cli db:migrate

You should see the normal output from the Sequelize CLI.

If you need to seed, run the seed command prefaced with heroku run as well.

** heroku run npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all

You should see the normal output from the Sequelize CLI.

If you ever need to roll back, DO NOT DROP YOUR DATABASE! Instead, migrate down and up.

** heroku run npx sequelize-cli db:seed:undo:all
** heroku run npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo:all
** heroku run npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
** heroku run npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all

If undoing the migrations and seeds don't work, you can reset the entire database by removing and adding the Heroku Postgres add-on that you added in the beginning of Step 2. Then migrate and seed again.

====== Additional Info ====================================
Before pushing to Heroku again in the future, you must add and commit your changes. Your general workflow should be something like this:

1. Team member commits and pushes an update
2. Somebody reviews and merges the Pull Request to the repository's base branch.
3. The "Team Lead" pulls the latest code
4. The "Team Lead" pushes the code to Heroku using the command git push heroku
5. The person that deploys the app should run any new database migrations. See the next section for that.
